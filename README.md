# Flinders.Processes.StudentSystem #

This repository contains a series of [UiPath][uipath] library projects. They are
used by the Robotic Process Automation (RPA) team at
[Flinders University][flinders].

The processes have been developed to support the Chancellor's Letter of Commendation
data entry processes in the [Student Management System][student-management].

## Documentation ##

Documentation on each process is available in the Flinders [internal wiki][wiki].
