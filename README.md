[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flindersuni/rpa-Flinders.Processes.StudentSystem.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/flindersuni/rpa-Flinders.Processes.StudentSystem)

This repository contains a series of [UiPath][uipath] library projects. They are
used by the Robotic Process Automation (RPA) team at
[Flinders University][flinders].

The processes have been developed to support the Chancellor's Letter of Commendation
data entry processes in the [Student Management System][student-management].

## Documentation ##

Documentation on each process is available in the Flinders [internal wiki][wiki].

## Continuous Integration ##

Commits to branches in this repository automatically trigger a build in
[Travis CI][travisci]. The build script automatically checks the project for
lint errors using the the [rpa-lint][rpa-lint] app developed by the team at
[Flinders University][flinders].
